## About Sylvarcon – Legacy Challenges

This repository contains the **legacy challenge write-ups** from the original *Sylvarcon 2049* “Steam Version”. These documents cover the solutions, thought process, and key techniques behind the missions played as **Ethan** and **Claire**, preserving the original experience for reference and archival purposes.

At this stage, the repository focuses on written material (walkthroughs, notes and support files). Due to size constraints, the original challenge assets (VMs, images, PCAPs, etc.) are **not** included here. Our intention is to make those legacy machines and resources available separately at a later date, once a suitable hosting solution and distribution format are in place.
