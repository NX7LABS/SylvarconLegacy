## About Sylvarcon – Legacy Challenges

This repository contains the **legacy challenge write-ups** from the original *Sylvarcon 2049* “Steam Version”. These documents cover the solutions, thought process, and key techniques behind the missions played as **Ethan** and **Claire**, preserving the original experience for reference and archival purposes.

At this stage, the repository focuses on written material (walkthroughs, notes and support files). Due to size constraints, the original challenge assets (VMs, images, PCAPs, etc.) are **not** included here. Our intention is to make those legacy machines and resources available separately at a later date, once a suitable hosting solution and distribution format are in place.

The original Steam build gradually became **technically obsolete**, and the project was eventually **retired and delisted from Steam in 2023**. These legacy write-ups are kept here as a historical snapshot of that version.

## What is Sylvarcon 2049?

*Sylvarcon 2049* is a cyberpunk, story-driven cybersecurity adventure that blends visual-novel style narrative with **real digital forensics and hacking challenges**. Instead of “simulated hacking”, players work with **real tools and real virtual machines** to investigate incidents, exploit vulnerabilities, and reconstruct what really happened behind each case.

The original Steam version featured **more than 45 challenges** across multiple difficulty levels, where you play as **Claire**, a seasoned forensic analyst, and **Ethan**, an expert hacker, each with their own investigation path and perspective on the same overarching story. All challenges were designed and built by **professional cybersecurity experts**, so the techniques you apply in-game map directly to real-world skills in DFIR, offensive security and threat hunting.

Sylvarcon’s goal has always been to sit halfway between a **cyber range**, a **narrative game**, and a **training platform**: you don’t just “play a hacker”, you actually learn how modern attacks and investigations work while following a long-form storyline.

## The new Sylvarcon platform

Although the legacy Steam version was retired in 2023, **Sylvarcon is now being relaunched in a completely new format**:

- A **revamped visual style** with a strong **manga / anime-inspired** aesthetic.
- A **brand-new set of challenges** (no simple recycling of the old content) – it is all **new material**.
- A redesigned flag and guidance model, making investigations clearer while keeping the depth of real forensics and hacking work.
- **Localization in more than 8 languages**, bringing the experience to a much wider audience.
- The option to obtain a **skills certificate** mapped to real-world cybersecurity competencies.
- **Owners of the legacy Steam version** will be able to access the **full premium package** of the new platform once their ownership is verified via Steam.
